    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>My Introduction</h2>
    <p> I am a 24 year old living in Chicago, IL. I was born in Yonkers, NY and my parents are from Dominican Republic. I have 2 siblings, 1 sister and 1 brother who are both older than I am. I am 
      considered to be the free-spirit of my family. I have a very welcoming and bubbly personality. I love working and socializing with others. I have been a Flight Attendant for the past
      3 years of my life. It is something I love to do since it allows me to travel for free! </p>
    <p> Here are a couple of things I enjoy doing </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Going on bike trails</li>
      <li>Being a tourist in a new city</li>
      <li>Learning new skills</li>
      <li>Spending time with my loved ones</li>
      <li>Reading non-fiction</li>
      <li>Play tennis</li>
      <li>Learning about myself</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Get To Know Me</h3>
        <p> I have always wanted to join the tech industry. I never knew where I would fit in until I went on Youtube. I watched a 30 minute vlog of a web developer. She described and showed
            what she did on a daily basis. Once I saw that, it clicked. I created a codecademy account and haven't stopped practicing to code since, this was in April 2020. 
            I am so excited to use my new skill and apply it to small businesses who need the help. I can't wait to keep learning how to fix issues easier and quicker. I love the idea
            of having team projects because I always find I work best when collaborating. It is a beautiful thing when you and others can combine all of your knowledge and create something.
            Aside from web development, I do enjoy learning about nutrition and politics. I love that those 2 things can make a huge change in my own mini world. </p>
